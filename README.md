# 🍰 The Melties: Home Bakery Dashboard

**Created by Anvitha Ganta**

This project is a passion + data story based on my own experience running a home bakery called *The Melties*. It uses mock sales data to explore customer behavior, product performance, and business insights through exploratory data analysis and dashboards.
